# sinem-ay.github.io
My personal GitHub page powered with Hugo

### Notes to remember when update comes for the website
To view changes in localhost:
```
hugo server --config hugo.yaml
```

After changes are made, update the `/docs` with:
```
hugo --config hugo.yaml --minify --destination docs
```

Then the updated website is ready to be pushed to main and deployed!
